# CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication

The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

## 1. Copyright and Related Rights

A Work means the copyrightable work of authorship and/or a database to which CC0 is applied by the Affirmer.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

- the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
- moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
- publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
- rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to limitations;
- database rights and extraction rights over a Work;
- and any other similar or equivalent rights throughout the world based on applicable laws.

## 2. Waiver

To the greatest extent legally possible, the Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of their Copyright and Related Rights in the Work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent permitted by law.

The Affirmer affirms that they have full authority to waive these rights. 

If a waiver of any right is not legally possible, the Affirmer grants anyone a **royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license** to exercise all Copyright and Related Rights in the Work for any purpose, without any conditions.

## 3. Public License Fallback

Should any part of the waiver be deemed legally invalid or ineffective, the Affirmer grants anyone a **royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license** to exercise all Copyright and Related Rights in the Work for any purpose, without conditions.

## 4. Limitations and Disclaimers

- The Work is provided "as-is," without warranties or guarantees of any kind.
- The Affirmer assumes no responsibility or liability for how the Work is used.
- The Affirmer does not guarantee that the Work is free of third-party claims of infringement.
- The Affirmer does not represent or warrant that they have secured all necessary rights for third-party content in the Work.
- Anyone using the Work is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws.
